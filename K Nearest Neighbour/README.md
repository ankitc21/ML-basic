# 📌 K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) – Classification

This project demonstrates how to apply the **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** algorithm using Scikit-learn for classification tasks. It walks through data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement the KNN algorithm for supervised classification.
- Understand the effect of the `k` value on model performance.
- Evaluate results using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualize prediction outcomes for better interpretability.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loaded a dataset suitable for KNN classification.
- Performed basic EDA (shape, summary statistics, value counts).
- Visualized data relationships using correlation heatmaps.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler` for distance-based learning.

### 3. KNN Model
- Applied `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn.neighbors`.
- Trained and tested the model using different `k` values.
- Identified the best `k` using performance trends.

### 4. Evaluation
- ✅ Accuracy Score
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
- ✅ Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ✅ Error and performance visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
