# 🔍 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier using Scikit-learn. It covers data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation on a classification dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply the **SVM algorithm** for binary/multi-class classification.
- Understand kernel-based classification and margin maximization.
- Tune SVM hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Evaluate model effectiveness using classification metrics and visualizations.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loaded a classification dataset.
- Inspected data types, shape, and missing values.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize features.

### 3. Model Building
- Implemented `SVC` from `sklearn.svm`.
- Configured kernel types (`linear`, etc.), `C` parameters.
- Trained and tested the model.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- ✅ Accuracy Score
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
- ✅ Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
