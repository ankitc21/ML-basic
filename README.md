# 🤖 Machine Learning Training Repository

Welcome to the repository for hands-on Machine Learning training! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources for **all major supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms**, aimed at helping learners and practitioners master core ML concepts through practical implementation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a complete, organized collection of ML algorithms.
- Implement both **supervised** and **unsupervised** models from scratch and using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and visualization tools.
- Provide a foundation for academic use, interviews, and real-world ML projects.
