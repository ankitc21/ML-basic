# 🌲 Random Forest Classifier – Supervised Learning

This notebook showcases the implementation of the **Random Forest Classifier** using Scikit-learn. It demonstrates how ensemble methods can improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and implement the Random Forest Classifier.
- Analyze dataset features and class distributions.
- Evaluate the model using appropriate classification metrics.
- Visualize and interpret model performance.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

### 1. Data Analysis
- Loaded a classification dataset.
- Inspected shape, missing values, feature types.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Split data into training and test sets.
- Applied `StandardScaler` for normalization.
- Handled encoding if categorical features were present.

### 3. Model Building
- Used `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`.
- Trained the model on the training set.
- Tuned hyperparameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth` (optional).

### 4. Evaluation
- ✅ Accuracy Score
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
- ✅ Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ✅ Visualized confusion matrix using `seaborn`
- ✅ Feature importance chart (if included)
