# 🧠 Naive Bayes Classifier with Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement the **Naive Bayes algorithm** using Python and Scikit-learn for classification tasks. It includes end-to-end steps: from data preprocessing and model training to performance evaluation and visualization.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand and apply the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.
- Train and test a model using real-world data.
- Analyze performance with proper evaluation metrics.
- Visualize key insights including prediction errors.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loaded a dataset suitable for classification.
- Explored features, targets, and class distribution.
- Checked and handled any missing values or inconsistencies.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Feature-target separation.
- Train-test split using `train_test_split`.
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.

### 3. Model Building
- Applied `GaussianNB` from `sklearn.naive_bayes`.
- Fitted the model to training data.
- Predicted class labels on test data.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- ✅ Accuracy Score
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
- ✅ Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ✅ Visual confusion matrix using `seaborn`
