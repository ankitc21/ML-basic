# 🧠 Naive Bayes Classifier – Binary & Multiclass Classification

This notebook demonstrates the application of the **Naive Bayes** algorithm for classification problems using the Scikit-learn library. It includes everything from data loading and preprocessing to model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of the Naive Bayes algorithm.
- Apply it to real-world classification datasets.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.
- Visualize results to better interpret model behavior.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

### 1. Data Analysis
- Loaded a dataset suitable for classification.
- Explored class distributions and feature summaries.
- Checked for missing values or outliers.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Split dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.
- Encoded categorical variables if necessary.
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.

### 3. Naive Bayes Model
- Implemented using `GaussianNB` from `sklearn.naive_bayes`.
- Trained the model on training data.
- Made predictions on the test set.

### 4. Evaluation
- ✅ **Accuracy Score**
- ✅ **Confusion Matrix**
- ✅ **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ✅ Visualized confusion matrix using `seaborn`
