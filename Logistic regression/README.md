# 📊 Logistic Regression – Binary Classification

This project demonstrates binary classification using **Logistic Regression** with scikit-learn. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization – ideal for anyone learning supervised machine learning classification.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of logistic regression.
- Apply logistic regression to a real-world dataset.
- Evaluate model accuracy using confusion matrix and metrics.
- Visualize prediction results and error distributions.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

### 1. Data Handling
- Imported a dataset relevant to binary classification.
- Explored data features and target classes.
- Handled missing values (if any) and prepared the dataset for training.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Scaled feature values using `StandardScaler` for better model performance.

### 3. Logistic Regression Model
- Trained a model using `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
- Made predictions on the test set.
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Visualized errors using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

### 4. Cross-Validation (Optional)
- Used `cross_val_score` for stability testing across different folds.
