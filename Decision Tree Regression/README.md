# 🌳 Decision Tree Regression with Scikit-learn

This notebook demonstrates how to implement a **Decision Tree Regression** model using Python and Scikit-learn. It walks through the entire process from dataset preparation to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Apply Decision Tree Regression to predict continuous values.
- Understand the effect of tree depth and model complexity.
- Evaluate performance using standard regression metrics.
- Visualize prediction trends and model behavior.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

### 1. Data Handling
- Loaded and explored a dataset with continuous target values.
- Checked for missing values and visualized feature relationships.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Feature-target separation.
- Train-test split using `train_test_split`.
- Optional: Feature scaling.

### 3. Model Building
- Implemented `DecisionTreeRegressor` from `sklearn.tree`.
- Tuned key parameters like `max_depth` and `random_state`.
- Trained the model on the training dataset.

### 4. Evaluation
- ✅ R² Score
- ✅ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- ✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- ✅ Residual plots or predicted vs actual plots for insights
